## quarantine-time-tcga

Here we will walk through several TCGA analyses in R.  They are ordered by date:

## Colon cancer analysis focused in circadian gene oscillation
The TCGA data was downloaded from UCSC Xena: https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/
The Sequencing data is too large to store on github, but the filenames and respective downlaoded locations are:
Colon_cancer_Seq.gz
https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?dataset=TCGA-COAD.htseq_fpkm.tsv&host=https%3A%2F%2Fgdc.xenahubs.net&removeHub=https%3A%2F%2Fxena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu%3A443

colon_cancer_phenotypes.gz

The initial list of clock genes were manually currated from teh Masri lab

GO Terms used were obtained from uniprot, for purposes of clarity, there are also provided as: Human_all_GO_terms.tab.gz

The scripts provided should detail the analysis.  Breifly, the steps are listed below:

1. we read in the datasets and chose samples which are informative (remove non-tumor and replicate samples based on barcode).  Information on how TCGA barcodes are specified can be found here: https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/TCGA_Barcode/

2. These are annotated as ENSMBL,so we will add the gene symbols from HGNC.  These data are found here: https://www.genenames.org/download/custom/ 

3. Retain only the genes of interest from assignment in "circadian" pathways, inspect their relative expression level and plot as "mean expression plot".

4.  Inspect intercorrelation among clock genes and how those relate to clinical traits
